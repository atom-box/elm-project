[^1] Know then offers this as one of their free courses.  The fact that it is for 0.18 (obsolete) means that certain critical syntaxes have compeletely changed.  But I am really enjoying it so far.  Not much has changed, and whatever has changed, is making me better at using the Elm-lang docs.  Totally do-able.  Moore is clear, gentle for beginners.
