# Elm resources for beginners
At first I just went to the same three or four places but everything has snowballed.   This is my third time of taking a month to learn Elm and if you have rolled a snowman, you know how fast things glom on after the first two rollovers.
## Books, tutorials, holding your hand projects

* Congenial author, very readable with nice illustrations and layout. [](https://elmprogramming.com/]( Thorough intro textbook) By Pawan Poudel.
* Project to build * [seven GUI's](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/), one of them in Elm language
* A new book from[Korban.net](https://korban.net/elm/book/) 
* The [Official Gitbook](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) including Evan's Elm Architecture examples
