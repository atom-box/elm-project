# Elm resources for beginners
Dozens of Elm links!  <br>
At first I just went to the same three or four places but everything has snowballed.   This is my third time(!) of buckling down to learn Elm and if you have ever rolled a snowman, you know how fast things glom on after the first two rollovers.

## Start here! Great bite sized nuggets and references
* [Elmstatic](https://korban.net/elm/elmstatic/) a static site generator

* Dennis Reimann's [lotta links](https://dennisreimann.de/articles/elm-tools-resources.html) from 2016
